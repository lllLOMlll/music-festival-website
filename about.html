North by Northeast is actively committed to work and correct systemic racism, prejudice, and oppression in the industry and to move towards equity.</p>

			<p class="p-about">We recognize the NXNE’s head office is on the traditional lands of Treaty 13 Territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. NXNE also acknowledges that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.  </p>

			<p class="p-about">NXNE is in allyship with Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements that stand for systemic change and against violence on Black, Indigenous, Racialized and systemically under-represented groups in Canada and around the world.</p>
